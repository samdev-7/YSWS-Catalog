# YSWS-Catalog

**YSWS-Catalog** is a web-based directory showcasing Hack Club‚Äôs "You Ship, We Ship" (YSWS) programs. Each YSWS program rewards participants for building and shipping projects‚Äîhardware, software, art, and more‚Äîby sending them physical or digital goodies. This repository hosts the source code for the catalog, allowing anyone to explore, filter, and learn about these initiatives. If you want to add or update a program, feel free to submit a pull request!

## TO ADD A YSWS - PLEASE MAKE A PR TO DATA.YML

The `api.json` and `feed.xml` files are automatically generated from `data.yml` using the generation scripts. 

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hackclub/YSWS-Catalog.git
   cd YSWS-Catalog
   ```

2. **Open the catalog:**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser.
   - Ensure all files (`styles.css`, `script.js`, `data.yml`) are in the same directory.

3. **Filter Programs:**
   - Use the top buttons (`All`, `Active`, `Ending Soon`, `Upcoming`, `Completed`) to filter the displayed programs.

4. **Search Programs:**
   - Use the search bar to find programs by name, description, or Slack channel.

## RSS Feed

You can subscribe to updates about active YSWS programs using our RSS feed:

- **Feed URL**: `https://ysws.hackclub.com/feed.xml`

This feed is automatically updated whenever new programs are added or existing programs' statuses change. You can use this feed with any RSS reader like Feedly, Inoreader, or apps like Glance to get notified about new opportunities.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the container for program cards and the modal structure.
- **styles.css:** Styles for the layout, cards, typography, responsiveness, and theme toggling.
- **script.js:** Contains the frontend logic for:
  - Loading and parsing YAML data from `data.yml`
  - Rendering program cards
  - Counting active programs
  - Filtering by program status
  - Searching programs
  - Handling theme toggling
  - Managing program detail modals
  - Updating deadlines in real-time
- **data.yml:** The main data source containing all YSWS programs organized by status
- **generate-json.js:** Generates a JSON file equivalent of the data.yml (for API use)
- **generate-rss.js:** Generates an RSS feed.xml file
